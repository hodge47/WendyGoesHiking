Hi!
Thank you for purchasing my assets!

You can find Object Placement Tool window under Window > NOT_Lonely > Object Placement Tool

Object Placement Tool can help you to populate your worlds with many objects using just your mouse right click. Simply drag and drop prefabs in the window, add a random to rotation and scale, press Enter Edit Mode and start populating you scene using Ctrl + Right Mouse Button.
Also you can use ctrl + shift + R to rotate selected object by 90 degrees along the Y axis, ctrl + shift + D to deselect all and ctrl + shift + G to snap selected objects to the closest grid point. 
These features are very useful when you building a level with the modular stuff =)
For more hotkeys look at Window > NOT_Lonely > Object Placement Tool > Quick Actions.

To clearly understand how to use all the features of Object Placement Tool, simply put your mouse cursor above the feature name in the Object Placement Tool window and you will see a tooltip.
