Hi there,

Before you will start to play with this project we recommend you to change Project settings to get same shadow like in our demo:

Go to Edit --> Project Settings --> Quality --> Change: 
1. Shadow Proejction to Close Fit
2. Shadow Distance 3000
3. Shadow Near Plane Offset 1
4. Shadow Cascades No Cascades

Thank you for your purchase of the Stylizer asset! We hope that it will change the look of your game into something unique & beautiful. :)

We would be very greatful if you could consider to rate & review our asset on the AssetStore.
